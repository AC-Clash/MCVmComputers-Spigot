VM Computers
==========
Run virtual machines inside vanilla Minecraft with a Spigot server!
--------------------------------------------------

MCVmComputers-Spigot is an attempt to make a Spigot plugin that functions similarly to the VM Computers mod. More information is coming soon.

Further Information
-----------
VM Computers is currently in the alpha development stage, so don't expect it to always work and be stable. That's why this resource isn't on Spigot yet. Beware of running this as it may be unstable. You may not want to run too many instances on one server either. I'm not responsible for your actions if your server crashes.

Compiling from Source
------
To compile VM Computers, you need JDK 8 or later, an internet connection, and preferably an IDE (IntelliJ is the best).

If you don't want to use an IDE, clone this repo and run `./gradlew build`. You can find the compiled jar in `build/lib` as `VMComputers-<version>.jar`. Otherwise, clone this repo, setup a project that uses existing resources, and configure maven to run `gradle build`.

Binaries
------
You can download the jar files in the releases tab if you don't want to compile VM Computers from source. Keep in mind it won't always be up to date with the latest commit.
